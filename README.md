Python Apps for my phone using pythonista!

## aurora-map.py
This will only work with pythonista on the iPhone as the libraries are exclusive to the Apple iPhone.  This will capture your location and then search a large JSON file provided by the [Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) and provide an index number and the times the forecast was modeled.  A map of the northern hemisphere is also displayed on your screen.

### todo
Allow for the adjustment to the southern hemisphere based on the location that was captured by the iPhone's location.

## clipboard-qr.py
On multiple occasions I needed to move some data around where a QR code would be nice to move quickly said data.
This program takes text from the clipboard, creates a QR code, and then puts the QR Code's PNG file on the clipboard.

The image is also shown in the console.
